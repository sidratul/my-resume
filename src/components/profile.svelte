<div class="profile">
  Experienced web developer in both frontend, backend and managing servers.
  I tend to weigh costs when developing applications.
  I enjoy learning new things about IT, and I spend time between weekends to learn new things or deepen my knowledge.
  I like to pay attention to everything, so I am one of those people who easily get to know other people.
  For subordinates, I can raise their morale but sometime preasure is neeeded because I think it is something that make people grow.
